        "abstract": "The high prevalence of osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is due to inflammation that stimulates differentiation of osteoclasts, a process involving circulating monocytes and T cell-derived factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate relations between circulating monocytes, T cell subsets, and changes in bone characteristics before and after treatment with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in RA.Thirty patients with untreated early RA who met the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR 2010 criteria were included. Data were collected before and 48 weeks after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) together with one of three bDMARDs (abatacept, tocilizumab, or certolizumab pegol). Disease activity was measured using the Clinical Disease Activity Index, swollen or tender joint counts, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Proportions of monocyte and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Bone densitometry was performed using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT).HR-pQCT revealed an overall decrease in cortical (P = 0.009) and trabecular (P = 0.034) bone mineral density, although a subset of patients showed no bone loss after 48 weeks of treatment. The overall bone loss was not associated with age, body mass index, sex, intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, or baseline disease activity. Loss of trabecular bone volume fraction correlated with high proportions of circulating CXCR3<sup>+</sup>Th2 cells (r = -0.38, P = 0.04) and CXCR3<sup>+</sup>Th17 cells (r = -0.36, P = 0.05) at baseline. Similarly, no loss of trabecular bone volume fraction correlated with high proportions of regulatory T cells (r = 0.4, P = 0.03) at baseline. However, the associations were not significant when corrected for confounders and multiple testing.MTX together with bDMARDs efficiently reduce disease activity but only prevent bone loss in a subset of patients with RA after 48 weeks of treatment. The correlations of circulating baseline T helper cell and regulatory T cell populations with trabecular bone changes suggest a potential novel role for these cells in systemic bone homeostasis during early RA.",

There was a total of 971901 patients from a hospital-based population in Taiwan. In this cohort, there was a total of 17065 osteoporosis patients with or without pathological fracture. In these patients, 7180 patients were osteoporosis medication users, and 9605 patients were non-osteoporosis medication users, after exclusion of previous RA. The risk of RA in the patients with osteoporosis medications was assessed, and stratified by sex and different medications, including bisphosphonates, denosumab, raloxifene and teriparatide.Patients with osteoporosis medication use had a reduced risk of RA compared with non-osteoporosis medication users [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=0.484, 95%CI: 0.270-0.867, p<0.05), after adjusting for age, comorbidites and medications. Specifically, patients with ever use of bisphosphonates (n=2069) or denosumab (n=4510) had a reduced risk of RA (aHR=0.405, 95%CI: 0.173-0.951, p<0.05, and aHR=0.394, 95%CI: 0.192-0.809, p<0.05, respectively). Notably, patients that only used denosumab (n=2938) had a further reduced risk of RA (aHR=0.32, 95%CI: 0.12-0.83, p<0.05), particularly in female patients (aHR=0.26, 95%CI: 0.09-0.74, p<0.05). Patients taking raloxifene or teriparatide did not have a significantly reduced risk of RA.Denosumab use reduces the risk of RA in patients with osteoporosis.

This study compares the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) between RA patients and controls without RA who had been treated with denosumab for 2 years for postmenopausal osteoporosis. A total of 82 RA patients and 64 controls were enrolled, who were refractory to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or bisphosphonates and completed the treatment of denosumab 60 mg for 2 years. The efficacy of denosumab in RA patients and controls was assessed using areal BMD (aBMD) and T-score of the lumbar spine, femur neck, and total hip. A general linear model with repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine differences in aBMD and T-score between 2 study groups. No significant differences in percent changes in aBMD and T-scores by denosumab treatment for 2 years at the lumbar spine, femur neck, and total hip were evident between RA patients and controls (P > .05 of all), except T-score of the total hip (P = .034). Denosumab treatment equally increased aBMD at the lumbar spine and T-scores at the lumbar spine and total hip between RA patients and controls without statistical differences, but RA patients showed less improvement in aBMD at the femur neck (ptime*group = 0.032) and T-scores at the femur neck and total hip than controls (ptime*group = 0.004 of both). Changes in aBMD and T-scores after denosumab treatment in RA patients were not affected by previous use of bisphosphonates or SERMs. Differences of T-score at the femur neck among previous bisphosphonate users and aBMD and T-score at the femur neck and T-scores at the total hip were evident. This study revealed that 2 years of denosumab treatment in female RA patients achieved comparable efficacy on BMD to controls at the lumbar spine, but showed somewhat insufficient improvement at the femur neck and total hip.",

Enthesitis and other tendon abnormalities, such as tenosynovitis, tendinitis and tendon ruptures are, also, common extra-articular manifestations of the disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of tocilizumab, an antibody that binds the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Receptor, on inflammation-related bone loss and tendon inflammation in an animal model of JIA.The Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) model was induced in male rats followed by intraperitoneal administration of tocilizumab for 8 weeks. Methotrexate, the most widely used Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug in the management of JIA, was, also, administered, either as a monotherapy or as an add-on therapy to tocilizumab. BMD was evaluated with Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) and histopathological examination. Tendon damage was, also, assessed histologically. Finally, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) and Interleukin-23 (IL-23) were quantified in tendon tissues by ELISA analysis.Tocilizumab-treated animals exhibited a significantly improved trabecular microarchitecture on micro-CT analysis and histological examination. Tendon morphology was also improved. Anti-IL-6 treatment led to a significant decrease in TNF-a and IL-23 expression in tendon tissue.The results of the present study provide evidence that tocilizumab reduces inflammation-related bone loss and suppresses tendon inflammation in a juvenile CIA rat model.

IL-23 and IL-17 have an essential role in the immunopathogenesis of RA, and P. IL-23 stimulates Th17 cells through which produces IL-17, IL-21, and RANKL. IL-17 stimulates fibroblasts to produce RANKL, which initiates bone loss in the joints in RA and the periodontal tissue in periodontitis. The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern of IL-23/IL-17 axis and soluble receptors isoforms sIL-23R and sIL-17RA of patients with RA presenting P (RAP).Healthy subjects (HS) (n = 42), patients with P (n = 40), RA (n = 20), and patients with RAP (n = 40) were included. Plasma samples were obtained to evaluate the IL-23, IL-17A, sIL-23R, and sIL-17RA by ELISA technique. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between groups. A Chi-square was used to compare gender, grade and stage of periodontitis, and DAS28-ESR between the groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to study the association between the molecules and clinical parameters.IL-23 levels were increased in the RAP group, and lower sIL-23R levels were found in the RAP groups. However, IL-17A was lower in the P and RAP group but not in RA patients. RAP group showed a decrease IL-17A levels in advanced stages of the periodontal disease.These results suggest that IL-23 and IL-17A tend to downregulate their expression patterns when patients present both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis.",

RA and PsA are heterogeneous diseases with substantial burden on patients. Increasing evidence suggests that the IL-23 signaling pathway may be involved in the development of autoimmunity and erosive joint damage. IL-23 can act either directly or indirectly on bone forming osteoblasts as well as on bone resorbing osteoclasts. As IL-23 regulates the activity of cells of the bone, it is conceivable that in addition to inflammation-mediated joint erosion, IL-23 may play a role in physiological bone remodeling. In this review, we focus on the role of IL-23 in autoimmune arthritis in patients and murine models, and provide an overview of IL-23 producing and responding cells in autoimmune arthritic joints. In addition, we discuss the role of IL-23 on bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts regarding inflammation-mediated joint damage and bone remodeling. At last, we briefly discuss the clinical implications of targeting this pathway for joint damage and systemic bone loss in autoimmune arthritis.",

Specifically, we used IL-23 in vivo gene transfer to induce arthritis in mice and showed that elevated serum LTB<sub>4</sub> and synovial expression of 5-lipoxygenase correlated with increased disease severity by histological evaluation and paw swelling compared with GFP gene transfer controls. To further investigate the effect of the LTB<sub>4</sub> pathway in bone loss, we performed osteoclast differentiation assays by stimulating with M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand bone marrow cells derived from BLT1<sup>+/+</sup> and/or BLT1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and used quantitative PCR for gene expression analysis in terminally differentiated osteoclasts. Deficiency in BLT1 resulted in the upregulation of osteoclast-related genes and an increase in the formation of giant, multinucleated TRAP<sup>+</sup> cells capable of F-actin ring formation. Additionally, BLT1 deficiency showed an increase of phosphorylated NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB levels in osteoclasts. We also performed real-time calcium imaging to study the effect of BLT1 deficiency in receptor activator of NF-κ-B ligand-induced activation of intracellular calcium flux in vitro.

Further biochemical analysis demonstrated that CA suppressed RANKL-induced activations of NF-κB and MAPKs (JNK and p38) leading to the downregulation of NFATc1.

Characteristic features of RA pathogenesis are synovial inflammation and proliferation accompanied by cartilage erosion and bone loss. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) display an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Several lines of evidence show that the Wnt signaling pathway significantly participates in the RA pathogenesis. The Wnt proteins are glycoproteins that bind to the Fz receptors on the cell surface, which leads to several important biological functions, such as cell differentiation, embryonic development, limb development and joint formation. Accumulated evidence has suggested that this signaling pathway plays a key role in the FLS activation, bone resorption and joint destruction during RA development. Greater knowledge of the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in RA could improve understanding of the RA pathogenesis and the differences in RA clinical presentation and prognosis. In this review, new advances of the Wnt signaling pathway in RA pathogenesis are discussed, with special emphasis on its different roles in synovial inflammation and bone remodeling.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether IL-18 has any indirect effects on osteoclastogenesis by regulating the production of molecules from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Human FLS were isolated from RA synovial tissue and cultured in vitro for three to five passages. The expression of IL-18 receptor was determined by RT-PCR. The levels of soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. Membrane-bound RANKL expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Both α and β chains of IL-18 receptor were confirmed in cultured FLS. IL-18 upregulated membrane-bound RANKL expression and soluble RANKL production by FLS in both time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, IL-18 enhanced production of M-CSF, GM-CSF, and OPG from cultured FLS in a dose-dependent manner. IL-18 also increased the ratio of RANKL/OPG, suggesting that the net effect of IL-18 on FLS favors for the induction of osteoclast formation and bone resorption.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effects of TQ and to investigate its influence on the major signalling pathways involved in pathophysiological RA changes. We used isolated human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model of RA. In isolated RA FLS, TQ (0-10 µM) was not cytotoxic and inhibited slightly lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced FLS proliferation and strongly H(2)O(2)-induced 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) generation. By studying different inflammatory and catabolic factors, we determined that TQ significantly abolished LPS-induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), metalloproteinase-13, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin E(2). Furthermore, LPS-induced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular-regulated kinases ½, and nuclear factor-kappaB-p65 were also blocked by TQ in time-dependent manner. In our experimental RA model, the oral administration of TQ 5 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the serum levels of HNE, IL-1β and TNFα as well as bone turnover markers, such as alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. The protective effects of TQ against RA were also evident from the decrease in arthritis scoring and bone resorption. In conclusion, the fact that TQ abolishes a number of factors known to be involved in RA pathogenesis renders it a clinically valuable agent in the prevention of articular diseases, including RA.",

        "abstract": "B cells play a crucial role in antigen presentation, antibody production and pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion in adaptive immunity. Several translational factors including transcription factors and cytokines participate in the regulation of B cell development, with the cooperation of epigenetic regulations. Autoimmune diseases are generally characterized with autoreactive B cells and high-level pathogenic autoantibodies. The success of B cell depletion therapy in mouse model and clinical trials has proven the role of B cells in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The failure of B cell tolerance in immune checkpoints results in accumulated autoreactive naïve B (B<sub>N</sub>) cells with aberrant B cell receptor signaling and dysregulated B cell response, contributing to self-antibody-mediated autoimmune reaction. Dysregulation of translational factors and epigenetic alterations in B cells has been demonstrated to correlate with aberrant B cell compartment in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, primary Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and pemphigus. This review is intended to summarize the interaction of translational factors and epigenetic regulations that are involved with development and differentiation of B cells, and the mechanism of dysregulation in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Mast cell activation induces pathological responses, including increased osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interleukin (IL)-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of IL-18BP on mast cell activation and mast cell induced osteoclastogenesis.Mast cells were activated by IL-33 (100 ng/mL) and cultured with IL-18BP (10, 50, and 100 ng/mL). The proliferation, apoptosis, and necroptosis of mast cells were measured using flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the levels of mast cell enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), soluble RANKL (sRANKL), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the culture media. Monocytes from patients with RA patients (n=5) were cultured with activated mast cells with various concentrations of IL-18BP. TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts, bone resorption area, and osteoclast differentiation-related genes were measured.Proliferation of tryptase+chymase+c-kit+FcεR1+ mast cells was suppressed following incubation with IL-18BP (10, 50, and 100 ng/mL). RNA expression levels of tryptase and chymase were reduced by 100 ng/mL IL-18BP. Additionally, the levels of MMP-3/9, IL-17A, IL-6, TNF-α, and sRANKL were significantly inhibited by 100 ng/mL IL-18BP. Annexin V+ and annexin V-PI+ mast cells were reduced following incubation with 100 ng/mL IL-18BP. The addition of IL-33 significantly stimulated mast cell and increased TRAP+ multinucleated cells and bone resorption area, and these effects were suppressed by IL-18BP. The osteoclast-related genes (TRAP, ATP6v0d2, RANK, and cathepsin K) expression were suppressed by IL-18BP.IL-18BP suppressed mast cell activation and mast cell induced osteoclastogenesis. This suggests a potential anti-arthritic role for IL-18BP in patients with RA.",

A rheumatoid arthritis rat model was induced by administering a bovine type II collagen emulsion subcutaneously at the base of tail, on day 0 and 7 of the experiment. Effects of the extract on severity assessment, changes in the hind paw volume, bone mineral density, body weight and body temperature were measured. Concentrations of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-6) released, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3 MMP-9) and their inhibitor (TIMP-1), haematological and biochemical changes were also measured. ELISA was used to measure the cytokines and proteinases in the rat serum and synovial fluid according to manufacturer's instructions.The extract dose-dependently modulated the progression in physical parameters (i.e. decrease in body weight, increase in body temperature, reduced hind paw volume, reduced the severity of arthritis), bone mineral density, haematological and biochemical perturbations, serum cytokines production and levels of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitor in the synovial fluid. Histopathological examination of the knee joint also revealed that the extract effectively reduced synovitis, pannus formation, bone resorption and cartilage destruction.The results suggest that the oral administration of a standardized extract of P. amarus was able to suppress the humoral and cellular immune responses to type II collagen, resulting in the reduction of the development of TCIA in the rats.",

Here, we observed that CB2 expression was markedly higher in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice synovium and bone tissues than in the noninflamed synovium and bone tissues. The CB2 selective agonist (JWH133) but not antagonist (SR144528) suppressed CIA in mice without toxic effects, as demonstrated by the decreased synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory responses, cartilage damage, and periarticular and systemic bone destruction. JWH133 treatment decreased the infiltration of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages and repolarized macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. Similarly, activation of CB2 increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6. In addition, JWH133 treatment attenuated osteoclast formation and osteoclastic bone resorption, and reduced the expression of receptor activators of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFAT-1) in CIA mice and osteoclast precursors, which were obviously blocked by pretreatment with SR144528. Mechanistically, JWH133 inhibited RANKL-induced NF-κB activation in the osteoclast precursors. We found that JWH133 ameliorates pathologic bone destruction in CIA mice via the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and modulation of inflammatory responses, thereby highlighting its potential as a treatment for human rheumatoid arthritis. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

        "title": "Periodontal Disease as a Risk Factor for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence to examine whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology and has a complex multifactorial pathogenesis affecting joints and other tissues. The natural history of rheumatoid arthritis is poorly defined; its clinical course fluctuates and the prognosis unpredictable. Rheumatoid arthritis affects up to 1-3% of the population, with a 3:1 female preponderance disappearing in older age. There is also evidence of a genetic predisposition to the disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by progressive and irreversible damage of the synovial-lined joints causing loss of joint space, bone and function, leading to deformity. Extracellular matrix degradation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis which is responsible for the typical destruction of cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and bone.Rheumatoid arthritis is characteristically a symmetric arthritis (symmetrical swelling of the joints). Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. Extra-articular signs can involve pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous, and reticuloendothelial systems. The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of the small joints is the most frequent finding. Rheumatoid arthritis onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients. Early rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by symmetric polyarthritis involving the small joints of the hands and feet with no radiologic changes. Rheumatoid arthritis most frequently affects the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved, which is peculiar because these are some of the most typical targets of seronegative spondylarthropathies, such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. The clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis vary, depending on the involved joints and the disease stage. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement is a typical sign of rheumatoid arthritis. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Progression of rheumatoid arthritis can be measured by laboratory tests and clinical evaluation (questionnaires of disease activity and physical examination). Laboratory tests include blood tests for Rheumatoid factor (RF) and Acute-phase reaction tests while clinical evaluation can be measured by the Disease activity using the Disease Activity Score (DAS). Periodontitis is a destructive inflammatory disease of the dental supporting tissues which leads to erosion of bone around teeth resulting in tooth loss. Severe periodontitis affects about 5-15% of the adult population. In periodontitis, the clinical findings of bone resorption and loss of clinical attachment level around tooth are a result of inflammatory mediated alterations to the bone remodelling balance. The inflammatory infiltrate present between the plaque biofilm, bone and connective tissues regulate the host immune response to the bacteria. The host produces proteases and substances that degrade the extracellular matrix, and lead to resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in irreversible loss of tissue attachment.Bone is a dynamic tissue and bone homeostasis involves the opposing events of resorption and apposition; dissolution of the existing bone mineral, resorption of the extracellular matrix, and formation of a new matrix. Bone homeostasis mechanisms maintain bone integrity in the alveolar bone (regulates periodontal bone loss) and, elsewhere in the body. It also functions to regulate the calcium balance within the body; this is an important ion as it is involved in the clotting of blood, formation of glandular secretions and regulation of the cardiac pacemaker.Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are arguably the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and associated with significant morbidities. rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis share similar clinical and pathogenic characteristics. Both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis present an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is thought to be responsible for the tissue damage. In this sense, both conditions are associated with destruction of bone, mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor and prostaglandin E2.Several studies have suggested a relationship between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid arthritis may have a negative impact on periodontal condition and vice versa. Mercado et al. in 2001 reported a significantly high prevalence of moderate to severe periodontitis in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the converse is true: periodontitis patients have a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis compared to the general population. One study found that induction of experimental arthritis in rats resulted in periodontal destruction and increased cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in the periodontal tissues.Oral bacterial DNA (deoxyribonucleic acids) is detected in serum and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis also have a significantly higher level of immunoglobulin G antibody against P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia. Furthermore, two recent clinical trials suggested that the treatment of periodontal disease might have a significant impact on rheumatoid arthritis severity. Similarly, subjects with rheumatoid arthritis have significantly increased periodontal attachment loss.In a recent research article, Ogrendik et al. in 2009 concluded that antibodies formed against these oral bacteria could be important to the aetiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. They recommended that gingival tissue infections should be considered in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and that periodontal infections should be treated and prevented from becoming chronic. If successful results are observed against periodontal infections in clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of the rheumatoid arthritis patients, the essential role of these bacteria in the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis can be proven. One hypothesis that links rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis is the recently published \"two-hit\" model that attempts to link experimental evidence from animal models and is supported by evidence from human clinical studies. In this theory, the first \"hit\" involves the periodontopathic subgingival biofilm and its microbial products, such as endotoxin. The second \"hit\" involves a medical systemic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which increases biomarkers of systemic inflammation in the circulation, including C reactive protein (CRP), cytokines (e.g. IL-6), prostanoids (e.g. PGE2), and matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α). These cytokines are thought to stimulate resident cells in the synovium and the periodontium to produce MMPs mediating connective tissue destruction, and induce the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts to destroy bone In particular, TNF-α, also promotes bone resorption: (i) by up-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO); and (ii) by modulating the receptor activator of nuclear factor _B (NF_B) ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts, and its antagonist osteoprotegerin (OPG), thus altering the RANKL/OPG ratio, which enhances osteoclast activity, and finally, lead to periodontal breakdown. Most recently Bartold et al, reported a series of experiments to examine the plausibility of the \"two hit\" theory investigated whether the onset and severity of experimental arthritis in a rodent model was influenced by the presence of a pre-existing extra-synovial chronic inflammatory reaction to P. gingivalis. They discovered that severe arthritis developed more rapidly in animals with a pre-existing P. gingivalis induced inflammatory lesion, thus providing further evidence for a relationship between the presence of periodontal pathogen-associated inflammation and the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Aggressive periodontitis is rapid progression of periodontal disease with severe periodontal breakdown. The amount and pattern of periodontal destruction is very aggressive indicating there may be other characteristics in addition that contribute to its rate of destruction, and hence is outside of the scope of this review.Before undertaking this review, the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline and CINAHL were searched. As no systematic review has been identified as been either published or underway on this topic, the aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence of periodontal disease as a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis.",

TAS5315 had dose dependent effects on Btk and basophil activation. In the SAD study, doses ≥2 mg resulted in mean Btk occupancy of almost 100% at 2 and 6 h, and >80% at 24 h, post-administration. TAS5315 1-8 mg/day inhibited basophil activation (mean change from baseline -55% to -89%). TAS5315 was generally tolerable. Although it dose-dependently reduced platelet aggregation (over 2-8 mg in both studies) and prolonged bleeding time (1-8 mg in the MAD study), no relationship between these effects and clinical symptoms was observed. All adverse drug reactions were mild and resolved without treatment; no noteworthy safety concerns were observed in either study.These data indicate TAS5315 has potential as a novel therapeutic for immunological diseases associated with aberrant Btk signalling, including RA and CSU.

Second generation inhibitors have a more acceptable safety profile although dose-limiting toxicity is still observed in some conditions, including RA.

This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02638948.Between Feb 24, 2016 and May 3, 2018, 248 patients were randomised (73 in the BMS-986142 100 mg group, 73 in the 200 mg group, 26 in the 350 mg group, and 75 in the placebo group; one post-randomisation exclusion); mean age was 56·7 years (SD 12·7); 214 (87%) of 247 were women, 33 (13%) were men, and 188 (76%) were White. Pre-specified interim analysis resulted in discontinuation of the 350 mg BMS-986142 dose due to elevated liver enzymes and absence of benefit versus placebo. Co-primary endpoints were not met. Response rates for ACR20 (placebo: 23 [31%] of 75; 100 mg: 26 [36%] of 73; 200 mg: 31 [42%] of 73) and ACR70 (placebo: three [4%] of 75; 100 mg: three [4%] of 73; 200 mg: seven [10%] of 73) were not significantly different to placebo; estimate of difference versus placebo for ACR20 was 4·9 (95% CI -10·2 to 20·1; p=0·52) for 100 mg and 11·8 (-3·6 to 27·2; p=0·14) for 200 mg, and for ACR70 the estimate of difference was 0·1 (-16·0 to 16·5; nominal p=1·00) for 100 mg and 5·6 (-10·5 to 21·9; nominal p=0·21) for 200 mg. Six patients experienced serious adverse events (four in the placebo group [mouth ulceration, open globe injury, rheumatoid arthritis flare, and endometrial adenocarcinoma] and two in the BMS-986142 100 mg group [angina pectoris and intestinal obstruction]); there were no deaths.Further investigation of BMS-986142 in people with rheumatoid arthritis is not warranted. An absence of clinical benefit in this study, together with other study results, highlights the need for additional research on the extent of BTK inhibition, treatment duration, and adequacy of drug distribution to inflammation sites, to understand the potential utility of BTK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.Bristol Myers Squibb.",

        "abstract": "The presence of autoantibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) in the absence of clinically-apparent inflammatory arthritis (IA) identifies individuals at-risk for developing future clinical rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is unclear why some ACPA+ individuals convert to clinical RA while others do not. We explored the possibility in the Targeting Immune Responses for Prevention of Rheumatoid Arthritis (TIP-RA) study that epigenetic remodeling is part of the trajectory from an at-risk state to clinical disease and identifies novel biomarkers associated with conversion to clinical RA.ACPA- Controls, ACPA+ At-Risk, and Early RA individuals were followed for up to 5 years, including obtaining blood samples annually and at RA diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated into CD19+ B cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD4+ T cells using antibodies and magnetic beads. Genome-wide methylation within each cell lineage was assayed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 beadchip. ACPA+ At-Risk participants who did or did not develop RA were designated Pre-RA or Non-converters, respectively. Differentially methylated loci (DML) were selected using the Limma software package. Using the Caret package, we constructed machine learning models in test and validation cohorts and identified the most predictive loci of clinical RA conversion.Cross-sectional differential methylation analysis at baseline revealed DMLs that distinguish the Pre-RA methylome from ACPA+ Non-converters, the latter which closely resembled ACPA- Controls. Genes overlapping these DMLs correspond to aberrant NOTCH signaling and DNA repair pathways in B cells. Longitudinal analysis showed that ACPA- Control and ACPA+ Non-converter methylomes are relatively constant. In contrast, the Pre-RA methylome remodeled along a dynamic RA methylome trajectory characterized by epigenetic changes in active regulatory elements. Clinical conversion to RA, defined based on diagnosis, marked an epigenetic inflection point for cell cycle pathways in B cells and adaptive immunity pathways in naive T cells. Machine learning revealed individual loci associated with RA conversion. This model significantly outperformed autoantibodies plus acute phase reactants as predictors of RA conversion.DNA methylation is a dynamic process in ACPA+ individuals at-risk for developing RA that eventually transition to clinical disease. In contrast, non-converters and controls have stable methylomes. The accumulation of epigenetic marks over time prior to conversion to clinical RA conforms to pathways that are associated with immunity and can be used to identify potential pathogenic pathways for therapeutic targeting and/or use as prognostic biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Due to optimised treatment strategies and the availability of new therapies during the last decades, formerly devastating chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis (SSc) have become less menacing. However, in many patients, even state-of-the-art treatment cannot induce remission. Moreover, the risk for flares strongly increases once anti-inflammatory therapy is tapered or withdrawn, suggesting that underlying pathological processes remain active even in the absence of overt inflammation. It has become evident that tissues have the ability to remember past encounters with pathogens, wounds and other irritants, and to react more strongly and/or persistently to the next occurrence. This priming of the tissue bears a paramount role in defence from microbes, but on the other hand drives inflammatory pathologies (the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde aspect of tissue adaptation). Emerging evidence suggests that long-lived tissue-resident cells, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, long-lived plasma cells and tissue-resident memory T cells, determine inflammatory tissue priming in an interplay with infiltrating immune cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin, and with systemically acting factors such as cytokines, extracellular vesicles and antibodies. Here, we review the current state of science on inflammatory tissue priming, focusing on tissue-resident and tissue-occupying cells in arthritis and SSc, and reflect on the most promising treatment options targeting the maladapted tissue response during these diseases.",

        "abstract": "The etiopathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, has been linked to human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOC) present in the environment. Chronic inflammation due to immune breakdown and malfunctioning of the immune system has been projected to play a major role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune disorders. Macrophages, major phagocytes involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation, are a major target of VOC. Excessive and prolonged activation of immune cells (T and B lymphocytes) and overexpression of the master pro-inflammatory constituents [cytokine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, together with other mediators (interleukin-6, interleukin-1, and interferon-gamma)] have been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory responses. The function and efficiency of the immune system resulting in immunostimulation and immunosuppression are a result of exogenous and endogenous factors. An autoimmune disorder is a by-product of the overproduction of these inflammatory mediators. Additionally, an excess of these toxicants helps in promoting autoimmunity through alterations in DNA methylation in CD4 T cells. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the possible role of VOC exposure in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases.",

This study was undertaken to determine if there is a common signature for all patients expressing anti-Ro 60 autoantibodies regardless of their disease phenotype.Using high-throughput multiomics data collected from the cross-sectional cohort in the PRECISE Systemic Autoimmune Diseases (PRECISESADS) study Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project (genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, combined with flow cytometry data, multiplexed cytokines, classic serology, and clinical data), we used machine learning to assess the integrated molecular profiling of 520 anti-Ro 60+ patients compared to 511 anti-Ro 60- patients with primary SS, patients with SLE, and patients with UCTD, and 279 healthy controls.The selected clinical features for RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and genome-wide association study data allowed for a clear distinction between anti-Ro 60+ and anti-Ro 60- patients. The different features selected using machine learning from the anti-Ro 60+ patients constituted specific signatures when compared to anti-Ro 60- patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the transcript Z score of 3 genes (ATP10A, MX1, and PARP14), presenting with overexpression associated with hypomethylation and genetic variation and independently identified using the Boruta algorithm, was clearly higher in anti-Ro 60+ patients compared to anti-Ro 60- patients regardless of disease type. Our findings demonstrated that these signatures, enriched in interferon-stimulated genes, were also found in anti-Ro 60+ patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those with systemic sclerosis and remained stable over time and were not affected by treatment.Anti-Ro 60+ patients present with a specific inflammatory signature regardless of their disease type, suggesting that a dual therapeutic approach targeting both Ro-associated RNAs and anti-Ro 60 autoantibodies should be considered.",

Our group has previously fabricated Ångstrom-scale silver particles (AgÅPs) and demonstrated the anti-tumor and anti-sepsis efficacy of fructose-coated AgÅPs (F-AgÅPs). This study aimed to uncover the efficacy and mechanisms of F-AgÅPs for arthritis therapy.We evaluated the efficacy of F-AgÅPs in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. We also compared the capacities of F-AgÅPs, the commercial AgNPs, and the clinical drug methotrexate (MTX) in protecting against K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis (STA) mice. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of F-AgÅPs and AgNPs on inflammation, osteoclast formation, synoviocytes migration, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) production in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the toxicities of F-AgÅPs and AgNPs in vitro and in vivo were also tested.F-AgÅPs significantly prevented bone erosion, synovitis, and cartilage damage, attenuated rheumatic pain, and improved the impaired motor function in mouse models of CIA or STA, the anti-rheumatic effects of which were comparable or stronger than AgNPs and MTX. Further studies revealed that F-AgÅPs exhibited similar or greater inhibitory abilities than AgNPs to suppress inflammation, osteoclast formation, synoviocytes migration, and MMPs production. No obvious toxicities were observed in vitro and in vivo after F-AgÅPs treatment.F-AgÅPs can effectively alleviate arthritis without notable toxicities and their anti-arthritic effects are associated with the inhibition of inflammation, osteoclastogenesis, synoviocytes migration, and MMPs production. Our study suggests the prospect of F-AgÅPs as an efficient and low-toxicity agent for arthritis therapy.",

Ershiwuwei Lvxue Pill (ELP), a prescription of Tibetan medicine, has been used for centuries for the clinical treatment of RA in Tibet, China. In a previous study, we reported that ELP could ameliorate RA symptoms in CIA rats by inhibiting the inflammatory response and inducing apoptosis in synovial tissues. It is still needed further to clarify the mechanisms of action of ELP in mitigating RA.In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism of action of ELP to improve RA joint damage and explore the changes in the intestinal flora and host metabolites.Firstly, we analyzed the main absorbed constituents of ELP in the serum of rats by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Then, we verified the alleviating effects of ELP on cartilage injury and bone erosion as well as the inflammatory response in CIA rats by microCT, H&E staining, safranin-O staining, and ELISA. Moreover, we investigated the main factors that mediate joint damage, including the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and osteoclast activity in the ankle of rats by immunohistochemistry and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Further, we explored the molecular mechanisms of the MMPs production and osteoclast activity in CIA rats treated with ELP through various experiments such as ELISA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assay. Besides, we investigated gut microbiota composition by 16S rDNA sequencing and serum metabolites through untargeted metabolomics. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between gut microbiota and metabolites by Spearman correlation analysis.In this study, we identified 20 compounds from rat serum samples, which could be the ELP components that improve RA. Moreover, we found that ELP could alleviate cartilage and bone injury by reducing MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 expression and osteoclast activity in CIA rats. Further studies demonstrated that ELP could reduce joint damage by inhibiting osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) /nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signal pathways. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the gut microbiota composition between the normal and CIA rats, and these differences were changed after ELP administration. ELP could alter the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and decreasing the abundance of Dorea, [Eubacterium]_ventriosum_group, Anaerostipes, Collinsella, Coprococcus_1, Ruminiclostridium_5, Ruminococcus_1, Family_XIII_UCG-001, Butyricicoccus, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, Lachnoclostridium, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010, Roseburia, Rs-E47_termite_group_norank, Treponema_2 genera. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis showed that ELP reduced arachidonic acid levels. The serum arachidonic acid level was significantly correlated with the abundance of 41 genera, particularly Collinsella and Lactobacillus.Our study shows that ELP can improve RA joint damage by inhibiting MMPs production and osteoclast activity, and regulating intestinal flora and host metabolites, which provides a novel insight into the ELP in alleviating RA.",

In this study, its therapeutic efficacy and the underlying mechanisms were explored using DBA/1J mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). It was demonstrated that astragalin could significantly attenuate inflammation of CIA mice. The effects were associated with decreased severity of arthritis (based on the arthritis index), joint swelling and reduced bone erosion and destruction. Furthermore, astragalin treatment suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), and inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13) in chondrocytes and synovial cells of CIA mice. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes derived from RA patients (MH7A cells) were applied to verify these effects. <i>In vitro</i>, astragalin inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13) dose-dependently in TNF-α-induced MH7A cells, with no apparent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, astragalin suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and the activation of c-Jun/AP-1 in TNF-α-induced MH7A cells. In conclusion, it has proven that astragalin could attenuate synovial inflammation and joint destruction in RA at least partially by restraining the phosphorylation of MAPKs and the activating of c-Jun/AP-1. Therefore, astragalin can be a potential therapeutic agent for RA.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly relevant public health problem. RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLSs) play an important role in RA progression. Long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) could improve RA by inducing RAFLSs apoptosis. However, the mechanism of GAS5 in RA remains unclear. RT-qPCR detected the expressions of GAS5, microRNA-128-3p (miR-128-3p), and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in RA synovial tissues and RAFLSs. Proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and transwell assays, severally. The protein levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), C-caspase 3, Bcl-2 related X protein (Bax), Tumor Necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 17 (IL-17), HDAC4, phosphorylation-protein kinase B (p-AKT), AKT, a phosphorylation-mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), and mTOR were assessed by western blot assay. The interaction between miR-128-3p and GAS5 or HDAC4 was predicted by ENCORI or TargetScan Human and verified by the dual-luciferase reporter, RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays. GAS5 and HDAC4 were downregulated, and miR-128-3p was upregulated in RA synovial tissues and RAFLSs. Function analysis indicated that GAS5 curbed proliferation, migration, invasion, inflammation, and facilitated apoptosis of RAFLSs. Rescue assay confirmed that miR-128-3p overexpression or HDAC4 knockdown weakened the inhibitory effect of GAS5 or anti-miR-128-3p on RA development. GAS5 acted as a miR-128-3p sponge to upregulate HDAC4 expression. Besides, GAS5/miR-128-3p/HDAC4 axis regulated RA progression partially through the AKT/mTOR pathway. Our studies disclosed that GAS5 restrained inflammation in synovial tissue partly through regulating HDAC4 via miR-128-3p, suggesting a potential lncRNA-targeted therapy for RA treatment.",

We investigated the roles of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) involved in RA-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) fibrosis. Firstly, we measured the expression of HDAC3 and interleukin 17 receptor A (IL17RA) in lung tissue samples from normal controls, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, and RA-ILD patients. Next, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual luciferase reporter assay were employed to detect the interaction between HDAC3 and microRNA-19a-3p (miR-19a-3p) and between miR-19a-3p and IL17RA. Further, immunohistochemistry was used to localize HDAC3 and IL17RA expression in lung tissues. Additionally, functional assays were conducted followed by expression determination of HDAC3, miR-19a-3p, and IL17RA with reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis. The effect of HDAC3 on RA-ILD in the constructed RA-ILD mouse model was also studied based on arthritis assessment. We found overexpressed HDAC3 and IL17RA as well as silenced miR-19a-3p in RA-ILD mouse model and RA-ILD patients. In the mouse model, HDAC3 downregulated miR-19a-3p in lung fibroblasts to promote the progression of RA-ILD fibrosis. In lung fibroblasts of RA-ILD mice, IL17RA was a target gene of miR-19a-3p. miR-19a-3p negatively regulated IL17RA, thereby increasing the expression of fibrosis markers, COL1A1, COL3A1, and FN, in lung fibroblasts of mice. Taken together, HDAC3 upregulated IL17RA expression by targeting miR-19a-3p to facilitate the RA-ILD fibrosis development, which sheds light on a new HDAC3/miR-19a-3p/IL17RA axis functioning in RA-ILD fibrosis.",

After the CD4+ T cells from healthy controls and active IBD patients were isolated and then transfected with miR-22 mimics/inhibitors, Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to measure expressions of miR-22, HDAC4, specific transcription factors in intestinal mucosa tissue and CD4+ T cells, while enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) to detect expressions of inflammatory cytokines in PB. Antisense miR-22 was administered into mice during trinitrobenzene sulphoni cacid (TNBS)-induced colitis to determine its role in IBD.A significant elevation of miR-22 but an evident decrease of HDAC4 was found in CD4+ T cells in PB and intestinal mucosa tissues from IBD patients. In addition, there was a great reduction in HDAC4 and a dramatic enhancement in Th17 cell specific transcription factor (RORC) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF-α) after overexpression miR-22, which was opposite to the effect of inhibition of miR-22. Furthermore, administration of antisense miR-22 in TNBS-induced mouse colitis model significantly decreased numbers of interleukin (IL)-17A+ CD4+ T cells and the expressions of IL-17A, RORC, IL-6 and TNF-α.MiR-22 was up-regulated in CD4+ T cells in PB and intestinal mucosa tissues of IBD patients, which could promote Th17 cell differentiation via targeting HDAC4 to be involved in IBD progression.",

        "abstract": "Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic autoimmune condition primarily prevalent in populations along the Mediterranean Sea. The exact etiology of BD has not been fully explained yet, but the disease occurrence is associated with a genetic factor, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 antigen. Among the various immunodysfunctions that are found in BD, patients are increased neutrophil motility and superoxide production, as well as elevated production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and decreased production of interleukin (IL)-10. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and IL-17 in BD have been found associated with aberrant expression of microRNA. Gene polymorphisms in BD patients have been observed in molecules involved in responses to pathogens that can ultimately modulate the host antimicrobial response. Moreover, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported in genes encoding chemokines and adhesion molecules; many of these changes manifest as increases in vascular inflammation and vascular damage. Lastly, genetic and epigenetic changes have been suggested as involved in the pathogenesis of BD. Modifications in DNA methylation have been found in BD patient monocytes and lymphocytes, leading to adverse function of these cells. This review presents a comprehensive compilation of the literature with regard to the immunodysfunction underlying BD, as well as of the genetics, newly described clinical specifications and novel treatment strategies using immunomodulants based on the current understanding of BD.",

        "abstract": "Uveitis is an inflammatory ocular condition characterized by an autoimmune etiology. Sinomenine (SIN), the main active constituent of the rhizome of Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd. et Wils., exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. The present study sought to investigate the therapeutic effects of SIN on experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in rats and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. A bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis, leading to the identification of the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways for further experimental validation. An EAU model was subsequently established, and the ocular surface morphology was examined using slit lamp microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunofluorescence was utilized to measure the protein expression and distribution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Experimental findings demonstrated that SIN significantly decreased ocular inflammation scores. Further validation revealed that SIN significantly elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) while reducing levels of IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β in EAU rats. SIN significantly suppressed the expression of phosphorylated proteins in the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways. In addition, it reduced the expression of RORγt while enhancing the expression of Foxp3, the transcription factors associated with Th17 cells and Tregs, respectively. In summary, our data demonstrate that SIN alleviates EAU inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways and restoring the balance between Th17 and Tregs. These findings highlight SIN as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of uveitis.",

As the principal pathogen in periodontitis, <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) is linked to an increased risk of multiple sclerosis progression; however, its role in central nervous system inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine whether <i>P. gingivalis</i> promotes peripheral Th1 cell differentiation via the ZAP70/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby exacerbating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis.C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into healthy control, periodontitis, EAE, and periodontitis with EAE group. Neurological function was assessed using Weaver's score. Histopathology (H&E, LFB staining) and Evans blue dye leakage evaluated inflammation, demyelination, and blood-brain barrier(BBB)permeability. Th1 and Th17 cells were quantified by flow cytometry, while immunofluorescence staining was performed to analyze Claudin-5, IFN-γ <sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T -positive cell and IL-17<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>-positive cell expression. Western blotting measured NF-κB and related protein expression. Reference-based mRNA sequencing analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment was conducted to identify differential gene expression and pathway enrichment.In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection significantly elevated Th1 cell proportions in the peripheral blood, increased interferon-gamma expression, and exacerbated central nervous system inflammation and demyelination by enhancing blood-brain barrier permeability. The infection also activated the ZAP70/NF-κB pathway, essential for peripheral Th1 differentiation, as evidenced by p65 nuclear translocation and significant upregulation of Th1-related genes, including those of the transcription factor <i>Tbx21</i> and interleukin-12 receptors. <i>In vitro</i>, <i>P. gingivalis</i> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated Th1 differentiation via ZAP70/NF-κB, which was effectively blocked by pathway inhibitors, reducing Th1 cells and pro-inflammatory factors.Our findings elucidate, for the first time, how <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection promotes central nervous system inflammation by driving Th1 cell differentiation via peripheral ZAP70/NF-κB pathway activation. This highlights <i>P. gingivalis</i> as a local periodontitis pathogen and significant contributor to neuroinflammation, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and identifying promising targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.",

This study investigates the potential pharmacological effects of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol commonly found in essential oils, as a promising treatment for arthritis. In vitro assays, including red blood cell membrane stability and protein denaturation tests, were conducted to preliminarily assess the anti-arthritic potential of linalool. Preclinical evaluations were performed on rats with arthritis induced by formaldehyde and complete Freund's adjuvant, focusing on the therapeutic effects of orally administered linalool over a 28-day period. Linalool treatment resulted in significant improvements in body weight, reduced paw inflammation, and decreased arthritis symptoms. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed that linalool reduced lipid peroxidation and elevated antioxidant levels in arthritic rats. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated a notable downregulation of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, IRAK, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-17, alongside an upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in linalool-treated rats compared to controls.

Therapeutic interventions enhancing expression or activity of SIRT1, an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase, support, at least in part, survival of RGCs in the face of injury. Herein, we used mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) which recapitulates axonal and neuronal damages characteristic of ON to identify gene regulatory networks affected by constitutive ubiquitous Sirt1 expression in SIRT1 knock-in mice and wild-type mice upon targeted adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SIRT1 expression in RGCs. RNA seq data analysis showed that the most upregulated genes in EAE mouse retinas include those involved in inflammation, immune response, apoptosis, and mitochondrial turnover. The latter includes genes regulating mitophagy (e.g., Atg4), mitochondrial transport (e.g., Ipo- 6, Xpo- 6), and mitochondrial localization (e.g., Chrna4, Scn9a). The constitutive or RGC-targeted SIRT1 overexpression in EAE mice upregulated the expression of non-mitochondrial genes such as Ecel1 and downregulated the expression of mitophagy genes (e.g., Atg2b, Arifip1) which were upregulated by EAE alone. Thus, SIRT1 induces neuroprotection by, at least in part, balancing mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy and/or enhancing mitochondrial self-repair to preserve the bioenergetic capacity of RGCs.",

As the first immune cells to reach the site of inflammation, neutrophils perform their biological functions by releasing many active substances and forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The overactivated neutrophils in patients with RA not only directly damage tissues but also, more importantly, interact with various other immune cells and broadly activate innate and adaptive immunity, leading to irreversible joint damage. However, owing to the pivotal role and complex influence of neutrophils in maintaining homoeostasis, the treatment of RA by targeting neutrophils is very difficult. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the interaction pathways between neutrophils and various other immune cells is crucial for the development of neutrophils as a new therapeutic target for RA. In this study, the important role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of RA through their crosstalk with various other immune cells and nonimmune cells is highlighted. The potential of epigenetic modification of neutrophils for exploring the pathogenesis of RA and developing therapeutic approaches is also discussed.
