        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with complex pathogenesis. Ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13), a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) superfamily, plays diverse roles in cellular events. This study investigates the role of USP13 in RA, revealing its significant downregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients compared to healthy individuals. USP13 expression negatively correlates with RA characteristics, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (RF). Consistent with these findings, USP13 levels were reduced in knee joint synovial tissues of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Mechanistically, USP13 directly interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), reducing its K63-linked polyubiquitination and thereby inhibiting TRAF6 expression. This interaction restrains nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, leading to a marked attenuation of LPS-induced inflammatory responses in BMDMs. Importantly, the anti-inflammatory effects of USP13 over-expression are largely dependent on TRAF6 suppression. In vitro, USP13 over-expression in BMDMs inhibits the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and osteoclastogenesis. In addition, USP13-overexpressing BMDMs in CIA mice significantly alleviates RA development, as evidenced by reduced synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage destruction, and bone loss. These findings highlight the essential role of USP13 in macrophages during RA progression and reveal its therapeutic potential by targeting TRAF6 signaling.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and abnormal osteoclast activation, leading to bone destruction. We previously demonstrated that the large extracellular loop (LEL) of Tm4sf19 is important for its function in osteoclast differentiation, and LEL-Fc, a competitive inhibitor of Tm4sf19, effectively suppresses osteoclast multinucleation and prevent bone loss associated with osteoporosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of Tm4sf19 in RA, an inflammatory and abnormal osteoclast disease, using a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Tm4sf19 expression was observed in macrophages and osteoclasts within the inflamed synovium, and Tm4sf19 expression was increased together with inflammatory genes in the joint bones of CIA-induced mice compared with the sham control group. Inhibition of Tm4sf19 by LEL-Fc demonstrated both preventive and therapeutic effects in a CIA mouse model, reducing the CIA score, swelling, inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone damage. Knockout of Tm4sf19 gene or inhibition of Tm4sf19 activity by LEL-Fc suppressed LPS/IFN-γ-induced TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages. LEL-Fc disrupted not only the interaction between Tm4sf19 and TLR4/MD2, but also the interaction between TLR4 and MD2. μCT analysis showed that LEL-Fc treatment significantly reduced joint bone destruction and bone loss caused by hyperactivated osteoclasts in CIA mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that LEL-Fc may be a potential treatment for RA and RA-induced osteoporosis by simultaneously targeting joint inflammation and bone destruction caused by abnormal osteoclast activation.",

One hypothesis posits that this connection arises from the formation of autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins (ACPA) in inflamed gums, possibly triggered by <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>. We previously demonstrated an increased antibody response to <i>P. gingivalis</i> arginine gingipains (anti-Rgp IgG), not only in individuals with severe periodontitis compared to controls, but in RA versus controls, with an association to ACPA. In the present study, we set out to further explore the relationship between anti-Rgp IgG, ACPA and periodontitis, including clinical periodontal parameters, in the large and well-characterized PerioGene North case-control study.We measured serum levels of anti-Rgp and ACPA IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in 478 patients with periodontitis and 509 periodontally healthy controls within PerioGene North. Subsequently, anti-Rgp IgG levels and ACPA status were analysed in relation to periodontitis and clinical periodontal parameters.Serum anti-Rgp IgG levels were elevated in cases versus controls (p< 0.001). However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that anti-Rgp IgG could not efficiently discriminate cases from controls (AUC= 0.63; 95% CI: 0.60 - 0.66). Among cases, increased anti-Rgp IgG levels associated with high periodontal inflammation and advanced alveolar bone loss (p<0.001 for both). An ACPA response was detected in 15 (3.1%) cases and 6 (1.2%) controls (p=0.033), but no association to periodontitis was evident after adjustment for age and smoking and anti-Rgp IgG levels did not differ between ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative individuals.We show that anti-Rgp IgG identifies a subgroup of periodontitis patients with high degree of periodontal inflammation and advanced alveolar bone loss, but we do not find support for a link between periodontitis or anti-Rgp IgG and ACPA status in PerioGene North. Given the association between anti-Rgp and alveolar bone loss, the mechanistic role of gingipains in bone resorption should be experimentally explored.",

Jinwu Jiangu Capsule (JWJG) is effective in tonifying kidneys, activating blood circulation, and dispelling wind and dampness. Meanwhile, it produces favorable clinical results in relieving joint pain and reducing inflammation. However, precise therapeutic effect and mechanisms of JWJG on RA remain unclear.The traditional Chinese medicine JWJG exhibits certain properties in anti-inflammation and pain relief for RA treatment. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of JWJG and elucidate its underlying mechanisms in RA treatment.A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was administered JWJG orally at varying doses for 28 days, alongside control and positive control groups treated with saline and leflunomide, respectively. Indicators including joint swelling, bone loss, histopathological changes, Th17/Treg lymphocyte differentiation, and inflammatory factor expression were assessed. RNA sequencing of synovial tissues identified JWJG-influenced genes and pathways. RASFs treated with ADCY10 lentivirus, PKA agonist, or AR plasmid underwent additional JWJG-containing serum or β-sitosterol treatment to monitor ADCY10, RANKL, and cAMP pathway alterations.JWJG administration significantly reduced joint swelling, bone loss, and inflammation, balanced Th17/Treg, and suppressed TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and RANKL levels. In RASFs, JWJG downregulated ADCY10, cAMP, and phospho-PKA/CREB, thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. Meanwhile, β-sitosterol decreased AR levels, which suppressed ADCY10 and RANKL expression. JWJG treatment could directly/indirectly inhibit ADCY10 reduced cAMP/RANKL, inflammation, and osteoclastogenesis, enhancing RA symptomatology comparable to leflunomide. It demonstrated superior regulation of Th17/Treg ratios and cytokine suppression, with potential to substantially improve RA patients' quality of life.JWJG inhibited ADCY10, decreased cAMP/RANKL, and impeded inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, with a notable improvement in RA symptoms comparable to leflunomide. It can be introduced as a potential new therapeutic strategy for preventing or even reversing bone damage and improving the quality of life for RA patients.",

This multifaceted functionality positions PGRN as a potential \"multi-effect therapeutic strategy\" for metabolic disorders characterised by cartilage degradation and imbalanced bone remodelling, potentially establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for such conditions. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, intervertebral disc degeneration, osteoporosis, periodontitis, and diabetes-related complications-representing the most prevalent metabolic diseases-currently lack effective treatments due to incomplete understanding of their precise pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed that PGRN expression levels are closely associated with the onset and progression of these metabolic disorders. However, the exact regulatory role of PGRN in these diseases remains elusive, partly owing to its tissue-specific actions and context-dependent dual roles (anti-inflammatory vs. pro-inflammatory). In this review, we summarise the structure and functions of PGRN, explore its involvement in neurological disorders, immune-inflammatory diseases, and metabolic conditions, and specifically focus on its molecular mechanisms in metabolic diseases. Furthermore, we consolidate advances in targeting PGRN and the application of its engineered derivative, Atsttrin, in metabolic bone disorders. We also discuss potential unexplored mechanisms through which PGRN may exert influence within this field or other therapeutic domains. Collectively, this work aims to provide a new framework for elucidating PGRN's role in disease pathogenesis and advancing strategies for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders.",

Methotrexate (MTX) is the standard first-line treatment for RA, but its clinical application is hindered by poor water solubility and non-specific delivery. In this work, a multifunctional drug-delivery nanoplatform that targets both macrophages and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is developed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MTX in RA. The nanoplatform consists of folic acid (FA, for macrophage targeting) and a TNFα-specific Aptamer (TNFα-Apt), facilitating a dual-targeting strategy that significantly improves the accumulation of MTX at the sites of RA lesions (≈3.5-fold). Moreover, the manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and polydopamine (PDA) coatings on the nanoplatform effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), generate oxygen, and promote the polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This shift in macrophage polarization restores the expression of key inflammatory cytokines, improving the local inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, the nanoplatform significantly ameliorates the inflammation and joint damage in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, suggesting that this multi-target combination therapy holds considerable potential for the treatment of RA in vivo.",

Current treatments for IBD are limited by relapse, drug resistance, side effects, and high costs. Glycine tabacina (Labill.) Benth, a legume native to southeastern China, has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties in treating rheumatoid arthritis, nephritis, and osteoporosis. However, its effects on IBD remain unexplored.This study aimed to investigate the anti-colitis effects and underlying mechanisms of Glycine tabacina ethanol extract (GTE) using in vitro and in vivo models.The chemical components of GTE were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of GTE on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed in Caco-2 cells. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice was used to evaluate GTE's therapeutic potential. ELISA, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting were performed to measure gene expression and signaling pathway activity. Histological analysis of colon tissues was conducted using H&E staining.GTE significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells and alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. Mechanistically, GTE decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), while improving intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, GTE suppressed the NF-κB and MAPK/JNK pathways while activating the Nrf2 pathway. These results suggest that GTE may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for IBD by modulating key inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways.The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of GTE mitigated intestinal epithelial cell damage by preserving tight junction proteins and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Given its high efficacy and favorable safety profile, GTE represents a promising therapeutic candidate for managing chronic and refractory inflammatory disorders such as IBD.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are comorbidities that share mutual pathways. IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in both diseases. One of the treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis is the use of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) such as anakinra. Anakinra tempers the disease by decreasing bone resorption and it could possibly stimulate bone formation. Here, we investigate the effect of anakinra in a periodontal disease setting on osteoclastogenesis by co-culturing periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that contain monocytes, a source of osteoclast precursors, as well as by culturing PBMCs alone. The effect of anakinra on PDLF-mediated osteogenesis was studied under mineralization conditions. To mimic a chronic infection such as that prevalent in periodontitis, 10 ng/mL of IL-1β was added either alone or with 10 µg/mL of anakinra. Osteoclastogenesis experiments were performed using co-cultures of PDLF and PBMCs and PBMCs only. Osteoclastogenesis was determined through the formation of multinucleated cells in co-cultures of PDLF and PBMCs, as well as PBMCs alone, at day 21, and gene expression through qPCR at day 14. Osteogenesis was determined by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) per cell at day 14. Anakinra is effective in downregulating IL-1β mediated leukocyte clustering and osteoclastogenesis in the co-cultures of both PDLF and PMBCs and PBMCs alone. Gene expression analysis shows that IL-1β increases the expression of the osteoclastogenic marker RANKL and its own expression. This higher expression of IL-1β at the RNA level is reduced by anakinra. Moreover, IL-1β downregulates OPG expression, which is upregulated by anakinra. No effects of anakinra on osteogenesis were seen. Clinically, these findings suggest that anakinra could have a beneficial systemic effect on periodontal breakdown in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking anakinra.",

To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region-targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease.

Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are a family of flavonoids found in the pulp and peel of citrus fruits, and have been reported to have potent antioxidant activity implicated in the prevention of human diseases. Several studies have shown that PMFs have a protective effect on bone resorption in mouse models of diseases, including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease. PMFs significantly suppressed the differentiation of osteoclasts (bone resorptive cells) through indirect and direct mechanisms. The indirect effect of PMFs is the suppression of inflammatory mediator production, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and the reduction of osteoclastic inducers, such as the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), in osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). The direct effect of PMF suppresses osteoclast differentiation and function by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. In silico molecular docking studies indicated that PMFs target the ATP-binding pocket of IKKβ and inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings suggest that PMFs protect against bone destruction by interfering with the NF-κB pathway in osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

While inhibiting osteoclastogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy, current treatments targeting the RANKL pathway (such as bisphosphonates and denosumab) are associated with severe side effects, necessitating the development of safer alternatives. We hypothesize that the compound (4E)-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylhept-4-en-3-one (DPHB), derived from Alpinia officinarum Hance, can effectively inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastic activity while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and bone resorption pit assays, we demonstrate that DPHB inhibits osteoclast formation and function. Mechanistically, DPHB suppresses both NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways while inhibiting NFATc1 activation and nuclear translocation, as evidenced by immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and western blotting assays. In a LPS-induced inflammatory osteolysis mouse model, intraperitoneal administration of DPHB significantly alleviated bone destruction, confirmed through Micro-CT scanning, histological staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

This study aims to evaluate BMP9's therapeutic potential in RA, focusing on its effects on bone destruction, osteogenesis, and inflammation.In this study, BMP9 expression was analyzed in synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis patients and in the ankle joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice using immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. The therapeutic effect of BMP9 on bone destruction was evaluated in a CIA mouse model through micro-CT imaging, histological analysis, and clinical scoring. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red S staining, while osteoclast activity was examined through tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Fluorescence double-labeling was used to track new bone formation. Data were analyzed using (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) SPSS, and appropriate statistical tests were performed to determine significance.In this study, BMP9 expression was significantly down-regulated in the synovial tissue of RA patients and in the ankle joints of CIA mice. BMP9 treatment in CIA mice ameliorated joint inflammation, as shown by reduced limb swelling, lower arthritis index, and improved tissue morphology. Furthermore, BMP9 significantly alleviated bone loss, as evidenced by increased bone mineral density and trabecular structure. However, BMP9 treatment did not significantly impact osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption. BMP9 also enhanced bone mineralization and formation, as shown by increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate. Additionally, BMP9 promoted osteogenic differentiation of synovial cells, enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral nodule formation. These results suggest that BMP9 has a protective effect on joint inflammation and bone loss in RA, potentially through promoting bone formation without influencing osteoclast activity.Our study concludes that targeting BMP9 alleviates inflammation and promotes osteogenic differentiation in RA, highlighting BMP9 as a promising therapeutic target for addressing bone destruction in RA.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis increases fracture risk, a cause of crippling morbidity and mortality. The immunoskeletal interface (ISI) is a centralization of cell and cytokine effectors shared between skeletal and immune systems. Consequently, the immune system mediates powerful effects on bone turnover. Physiologically, B cells secrete osteoprotegerin (OPG), a potent anti-osteoclastogenic factor that preserves bone mass. However, activated T cells and B cells secrete pro-osteoclastogenic factors including receptor activator of Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), Interleukin (IL)-17A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α promoting bone loss in inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, ISI disruption has been linked to osteoporosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), where elevated B cell RANKL and diminished OPG drive bone resorption. HIV-antiretroviral therapy paradoxically intensifies bone loss during disease reversal, as immune reconstitution produces osteoclastogenic cytokines. Interestingly, in estrogen deficiency, activated T cells secrete RANKL, TNF, and IL-17A that amplify bone resorption and contribute to postmenopausal osteoporosis. T cell-produced TNF and IL-17A further contribute to bone loss in hyperparathyroidism, while T cell production of the anabolic Wingless integration site (Wnt) ligand, Wnt10b, promotes bone formation in response to anabolic parathyroid hormone and the immunomodulatory costimulation inhibitor cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4-IgG (abatacept). These findings provide a window into the workings of the ISI and suggest novel targets for future therapeutic interventions to reduce fracture risk.",

        "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) is a cytokine produced by monocytes, macrophages, and T cells and is induced by pathogens, endotoxins, or related substances. TNF- α may play a key role in bone metabolism and is important in inflammatory bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Cells directly involved in osteoclastogenesis include macrophages, which are osteoclast precursor cells, osteoblasts, or stromal cells. These cells express receptor activator of NF- κ B ligand (RANKL) to induce osteoclastogenesis, and T cells, which secrete RANKL, promote osteoclastogenesis during inflammation. Elucidating the detailed effects of TNF- α on bone metabolism may enable the identification of therapeutic targets that can efficiently suppress bone destruction in inflammatory bone diseases. TNF- α is considered to act by directly increasing RANK expression in macrophages and by increasing RANKL in stromal cells. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 12, IL-18, and interferon- γ (IFN- γ ) strongly inhibit osteoclast formation. IL-12, IL-18, and IFN- γ induce apoptosis in bone marrow cells treated with TNF- α   in vitro, and osteoclastogenesis is inhibited by the interactions of TNF- α -induced Fas and Fas ligand induced by IL-12, IL-18, and IFN- γ .

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease and aseptic periprosthetic osteolysis, are characterized by bone loss around affected joints and teeth caused by increased osteoclastic bone resorption. This resorption is mediated largely by the increased local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa). These cytokines may induce resorption indirectly by affecting the production of the essential osteoclast differentiation factor, receptor activator of NF-kB ligand, and/or its soluble decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin, by osteoblast/stromal cells or directly by enhancing proliferation and/or activity of cells in the osteoclast lineage. The importance of TNFa in the pathogenesis of various forms of bone loss is supported by both experimental and clinical evidence. However, TNFa is not absolutely required for osteoclastogenesis, erosive arthritis, or osteolysis, as all these events could occur in the absence of TNFa and whether TNFa promotes osteoclast formation independently of RANK signaling is still a topic of debate. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby TNFa increases osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo.",

Synovial T cells were isolated from RA synovial tissue. The levels of soluble receptor activator of the NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), IFN gamma, M-CSF, and GM-CSF were determined by ELISA. Membrane bound RANKL expression was analysed by flow cytometry. Commercially available human osteoclast precursors were cocultured with T cells to induce osteoclast formation, which was determined with tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining and pit formation assay.In PHA prestimulated T cells or RA synovial T cells, IL18, IL1 beta, or TNFalpha increased soluble RANKL production and membrane bound RANKL expression in a dose dependent manner. IL18, IL1 beta, and TNF alpha did not induce M-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN gamma, or OPG production in PHA prestimulated T cells or RA synovial T cells. IL18 increased the number of osteoclasts and bone resorption area on dentine slices in the coculture of human osteoclast precursors with PHA prestimulated T cells or RA synovial T cells; its ability was equivalent to that of IL1 beta, but less potent than that of TNF alpha. In the coculture system, OPG completely blocked osteoclast induction by IL18 or IL1 beta, and greatly inhibited induction by TNF alpha.IL18, IL1 beta, or TNF alpha can indirectly stimulate osteoclast formation through up regulation of RANKL production from T cells in RA synovitis; IL18 is as effective as IL1 beta, but less potent than TNF alpha.",

        "abstract": "Clinical development of BTK kinase inhibitors for treating autoimmune diseases has lagged behind development of these drugs for treating cancers, due in part from concerns over the lack of selectivity and associated toxicity profiles of first generation drug candidates when used in the long term treatment of immune mediated diseases. Second generation BTK inhibitors have made great strides in limiting off-target activities for distantly related kinases, though they have had variable success at limiting cross-reactivity within the more closely related TEC family of kinases. We investigated the BTK specificity and toxicity profiles, drug properties, disease associated signaling pathways, clinical indications, and trial successes and failures for the 13 BTK inhibitor drug candidates tested in phase 2 or higher clinical trials representing 7 autoimmune and 2 inflammatory immune-mediated diseases. We focused on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) where the majority of BTK nonclinical and clinical studies have been reported, with additional information for pemphigus vulgaris (PV), Sjogren's disease (SJ), chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), graft <i>versus</i> host disease (GVHD), and asthma included where available. While improved BTK selectivity <i>versus</i> kinases outside the TEC family improved clinical toxicity profiles, less profile distinction was evident within the TEC family. Analysis of genetic associations of RA, MS, and SLE biomarkers with TEC family members revealed that BTK and TEC family members may not be drivers of disease. They are, however, mediators of signaling pathways associated with the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases. BTK in particular may be associated with B cell and myeloid differentiation as well as autoantibody development implicated in immune mediated diseases. Successes in the clinic for treating RA, MS, PV, ITP, and GVHD, but not for SLE and SJ support the concept that BTK plays an important role in mediating pathogenic processes amenable to therapeutic intervention, depending on the disease. Based on the data collected in this study, we propose that current compound characteristics of BTK inhibitor drug candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases have achieved the selectivity, safety, and coverage requirements necessary to deliver therapeutic benefit.",

        "abstract": "The high prevalence of osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is due to inflammation that stimulates differentiation of osteoclasts, a process involving circulating monocytes and T cell-derived factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate relations between circulating monocytes, T cell subsets, and changes in bone characteristics before and after treatment with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in RA.Thirty patients with untreated early RA who met the American College of Rheumatology/EULAR 2010 criteria were included. Data were collected before and 48 weeks after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) together with one of three bDMARDs (abatacept, tocilizumab, or certolizumab pegol). Disease activity was measured using the Clinical Disease Activity Index, swollen or tender joint counts, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Proportions of monocyte and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Bone densitometry was performed using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT).HR-pQCT revealed an overall decrease in cortical (P = 0.009) and trabecular (P = 0.034) bone mineral density, although a subset of patients showed no bone loss after 48 weeks of treatment. The overall bone loss was not associated with age, body mass index, sex, intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, or baseline disease activity. Loss of trabecular bone volume fraction correlated with high proportions of circulating CXCR3<sup>+</sup>Th2 cells (r = -0.38, P = 0.04) and CXCR3<sup>+</sup>Th17 cells (r = -0.36, P = 0.05) at baseline. Similarly, no loss of trabecular bone volume fraction correlated with high proportions of regulatory T cells (r = 0.4, P = 0.03) at baseline. However, the associations were not significant when corrected for confounders and multiple testing.MTX together with bDMARDs efficiently reduce disease activity but only prevent bone loss in a subset of patients with RA after 48 weeks of treatment. The correlations of circulating baseline T helper cell and regulatory T cell populations with trabecular bone changes suggest a potential novel role for these cells in systemic bone homeostasis during early RA.",

Specifically, an increase in senescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including T cells, is associated with conditions like frailty, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone loss. However, it is unknown if the percentage of senescent PBMCs associated with age-associated orthopedic decline could be used for potential diagnostic or prognostic use in orthopedics.

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an ongoing inflammatory condition that affects the joints and can lead to severe damage to cartilage and bones, resulting in significant disability. This condition occurs when the immune system becomes overactive, causing osteoclasts, cells responsible for breaking down bone, to become more active than necessary, leading to bone breakdown. RA disrupts the equilibrium between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, resulting in serious complications such as localized bone erosion, weakened bones surrounding the joints, and even widespread osteoporosis. Antibodies against the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), a crucial stimulator of osteoclast differentiation, have shown great effectiveness both in laboratory settings and actual patient cases. Researchers are increasingly focusing on osteoclasts as significant contributors to bone erosion in RA. Given that RA involves an overactive immune system, T cells and B cells play a pivotal role by intensifying the immune response. The imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells, premature aging of T cells, and excessive production of antibodies by B cells not only exacerbate inflammation but also accelerate bone destruction. Understanding the connection between the immune system and osteoclasts is crucial for comprehending the impact of RA on bone health. By delving into the immune mechanisms that lead to joint damage, exploring the interactions between the immune system and osteoclasts, and investigating new biomarkers for RA, we can significantly improve early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this condition.",

MDA is an oxidation-associated reactive aldehyde that together with acetaldehyde mediates formation of various immunogenic amino acid adducts including linear MDA-lysine, fluorescent malondialdehyde acetaldehyde (MAA)-lysine, and intramolecular cross-linking. We used single-cell cloning, generation of recombinant antibodies (n = 356 from 25 donors), and antigen-screening to investigate the presence of class-switched MDA/MAA+ B cells in RA synovium, bone marrow, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Anti-MDA/MAA+ B cells were found in bone marrow plasma cells of late disease and in the lung of both early disease and risk-individuals and in different B cell subsets (memory, double negative B cells). These were compared with previously identified anti-MDA/MAA from synovial memory and plasma cells. Seven out of eight clones carried somatic hypermutations and all bound MDA/MAA-lysine independently of protein backbone. However, clones with somatic hypermutations targeted MAA cross-linked structures rather than MDA- or MAA-hapten, while the germline-encoded synovial clone instead bound linear MDA-lysine in proteins and peptides. Binding patterns were maintained in germline converted clones. Affinity purification of polyclonal anti-MDA/MAA from patient serum revealed higher proportion of anti-MAA versus anti-MDA compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, IgG anti-MDA/MAA show distinct targeting of different molecular structures.

The development and progression of RA involves a complex interplay between an individual's genetic background and various environmental factors. In order to effectively manage RA, a multidisciplinary approach is required, as this disease is complicated and its pathophysiological mechanism is not fully understood yet. In majority of arthritis patients, the presence of abnormal B cells and autoantibodies, primarily anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and rheumatoid factor affects the progression of RA. Therefore, drugs targeting B cells have now become a hot topic in the treatment of RA which is quite evident from the recent trends seen in the discovery of various B cell receptors (BCRs) targeting agents. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is one of these recent targets which play a role in the upstream phase of BCR signalling. BTK is an important enzyme that regulates the survival, proliferation, activation and differentiation of B-lineage cells by preventing BCR activation, FC-receptor signalling and osteoclast development.

Patients diagnosed with RA develop deformity of joints and show gradual functional impairment if they do not receive treatment within the desired timeline. The availability of biological treatments and the introduction of treat-to-target regimens have dramatically enhanced the outcome for patients treated with RA conditions. Nevertheless, there is still attention required for RA because patients do not respond adequately to currently available treatment regimens. Over the past few decades, newer therapy methods are evolving to better understand the in-depth literature behind the actual cause of RA. Thus, getting an insight into the importance of RA there is a need for a shift in the existing treatment. This article focuses on a comprehensive review of the therapeutic potential of newer targets such as Janus Kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Pathway, Phosphoinositide-3-kinase Pathway, Dendritic cells, Neuropathway, Receptor activator of nuclearfactor-kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) Inhibitors, Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Synovial Anatomy emphasizing on Synovial fibroblasts Myeloid Cells which have been summarized.

Furthermore, the article provides an in-depth understanding of the exact mechanism in underlying pathophysiology in RA and thereby substantiating their evident therapeutic effect with ongoing clinical trials.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing preventive measures and therapeutic strategies, especially for rubber tappers at risk in the Amazon region.This study investigated the effects of P. semirufa bristle extracts on human chondrocytes, focusing on the activation mechanism of the NF-κB transcription factor and the expression of osteoarthritis markers. Cell viability tests indicated that the extracts did not significantly affect chondrocyte survival. However, supernatant analysis revealed a time- and dose-dependent increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Additionally, the expression of NF-κB and its inhibitor, IκB, was assessed, showing higher levels of phosphorylated IκB, which induces its proteosomal degradation, compared to the negative control, while native IκB expression was greater in the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of treated chondrocytes demonstrated modulation in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), aggrecan (ACAN), collagen type II (COL2A1), interleukins (IL6 and IL8), and complement system molecules.These findings highlight the significant impact of P. semirufa bristle extracts on human chondrocyte activation and the inflammatory processes associated with pararamosis.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disease and drug therapy has been restricted due to poor therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects. In RA synovium, dendritic cells present self-antigens to activate cascade immune pathway. Furthermore, downstream macrophages secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; Hyperplasia of activated synovial fibroblasts (FLS) is responsible for hypoxic synovium microenvironment, secretion of cytokines/chemokines and erosion of bone/cartilage tissues. Positive feedback loop of inflammation between macrophages and FLS independent of antigen-presentation is constructed. Herein, an injectable pH-sensitive peptide hydrogel encapsulating siRNA/Methotrexate-polyethyleneimine (siMP, including sip65MP, sip38MP, siCD86MP) and Bismuthene nanosheet/Methotrexate-polyethyleneimine (BiMP) is successfully developed. Among them, siCD86MP reduces protein level of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 while sip65MP and sip38MP separately inhibit NF-κB and MAPK-p38 pathways of macrophages and FLS to suppress secretion of cytokines and MMPs. Meanwhile, reduction in anti-apoptotic property of FLS induced by inhibition of NF-κB pathway has a synergistic effect with photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by BiMP for FLS elimination, effectively ameliorating hypoxic synovium microenvironment. After being injected into synovium, hydrogel responds to acidic microenvironment and serves as a reservoir for sustained drug release and inherent retention capacity of which enables cationic nanoparticles to bypass tissue barrier for precise synovium targeting. This brand-new drug delivery system combines modulating cascade immune pathway from beginning to end by RNAi and eliminating FLS for improving synovium microenvironment by phototherapy together, providing a robust strategy for clinical RA treatment.",

        "abstract": "Physiological health must balance immunological responsiveness against foreign pathogens with tolerance toward self-components and commensals. Disruption of this balance causes autoimmune diseases/chronic inflammation, in case of excessive immune responses, and persistent infection/immunodeficiency if regulatory components are overactive. This homeostasis occurs at two different levels: at a resting state to prevent autoimmune disease, as autoreactive effector T-cells (Teffs) are only partially deleted in the thymus, and during inflammation to prevent excessive tissue injury, contract the immune response, and enable tissue repair. Adaptive immune cells with regulatory function (\"regulatory T-cells\") are essential to control Teffs. Two sets of regulatory T cell are required to achieve the desired control: those emerging de novo from embryonic/neonatal thymus (\"thymic\" or tTregs), whose function is to control autoreactive Teffs to prevent autoimmune diseases, and those induced in the periphery (\"peripheral\" or pTregs) to acquire regulatory phenotype in response to pathogens/inflammation. The differentiation mechanisms of these cells determine their commitment to lineage and plasticity toward other phenotypes. tTregs, expressing high levels of IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), and the transcription factor Foxp3, are the most important, since mutations or deletions in these genes cause fatal autoimmune diseases in both mice and men. In the periphery, instead, Foxp3(+) pTregs can be induced from naïve precursors in response to environmental signals. Here, we discuss molecular signatures and induction processes, mechanisms and sites of action, lineage stability, and differentiating characteristics of both Foxp3(+) and Foxp3(-) populations of regulatory T cells, derived from the thymus or induced peripherally. We relate these predicates to programs of cell-based therapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and induction of tolerance to transplants.",

Research demonstrated STAT3 signalling to be upregulated in Pso. Additionally, Pso results in oxidative stress that activates various signalling pathways like factor nuclear kappa-B (NF-κB). Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antiprotozoal drug shown to inhibit the STAT3 pathway. Umbelliferone (UMB) is an antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and can suppress NF-κB signalling. Therefore, we propose to hypothesize that NTZ and UMB would be effective in treating Pso. Balb/c mice were treated with IMQ to induce Pso. The clinical characteristics of Pso were assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), back skin thickness, spleen length and mass, and histology of the skin sample tissue. In addition, we measured the levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), STAT3, and NF-κB. Furthermore, to gain the interaction of NTZ and UMB with STAT3, a detailed in-silico study has been performed. The impact of treatment on oxidative stress was evaluated by estimating the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The results demonstrate that mice subjected to IMQ-induced Pso exhibited positive responses to treatment with NTZ and UMB. Additionally, IL-17, TNF-α levels, STAT3, and NF-κB were decreased in NTZ and UMB-treated groups. SOD and CAT levels in NTZ and UMB groups were elevated.

Advanced research on these mechanisms has introduced new drugs for MM into clinical practice. However, several challenges occur, particularly in cases of relapsed and refractory MM. In recent years, bortezomib has been recognized, for its anti-myeloma effect in both newly identified and refractory MM patients, but its mechanism of action on MM remains unexplored. Consequently, this study aims to explore the influence of bortezomib on coagulation function, renal function, immune function, and related indexes of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway in MM patients. <b>Methods</b> This retrospective study analyzed 120 MM patients admitted to the First People's Hospital of Nantong, China, between August 2018 and August 2023. Based on different treatment methods, patients were divided into a control group (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (TCD), 58 cases) and an observation group (TCD regimen and bortezomib, 62 cases). The therapeutic efficacy of the drug was observed, and the levels of blood indexes, coagulation function indexes, NF-κB related indexes, renal function indexes and immunosuppressive factors were compared between the groups both before and after treatment. <b>Results</b> There were no significant differences in disease control rate (DCR) between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). After treatment, the objective response rate (ORR) and the hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group, with lower M protein levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the prothrombin time (PT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB) values, <i>NF-κB</i> expression levels, β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels were substantially decreased in the observation group compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, the progression-free survival rate was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the overall survival (OS) rate between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Moreover, the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 11.95 months in the observation group and 9 months in the control group, while the median OS time was 11.7 months in the control group. <b>Conclusion</b> In summary, bortezomib treatment improves coagulation and renal function in MM patients.

This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of α-DIPA on microglia and the underlying pathways.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglial inflammation was used as an in vitro model. α-DIPA effects were assessed via ELISA for nitric oxide (NO) release, flow cytometry was used to examine cell proliferation, activation and polarization, and transcriptomic analysis was applied to identify key signaling pathways regulated by α-DIPA.ELISA results showed that exogenous α-DIPA treatment significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO release from BV-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis suggested that 40 µM α-DIPA treatment significantly repressed LPS-induced BV-2 cell proliferation, activation, as well as M1 and M2 type polarization. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that exogenous α-DIPA extensively and drastically decreased the transcriptional level of numerous genes that are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, for instance, proinflammatory genes such as Tnf and Ccl3 related to IL-17 and TNF-α signaling. In addition, we also observed that the expression of multiple genes in NF-κB signaling were also inhibited greatly by α-DIPA, such as Nfkb2 and Nfkbia. Notably, α-DIPA robustly suppressed LPS-induced mRNA expression of abundant genes participating in the ferroptosis pathway, including Acsl4, Slc7a11, Me1, and Hmox1. Interestingly, the expressions of multiple ferroptosis-related genes were regulated specifically by α-DIPA but not LPS, such as Acsl5, Acsl6, Alox5, Cars, Dpp3, Dpp10, Slc2a5, and Slc7a1.α-DIPA inhibits microglial inflammation likely through regulating the pathways of the ferroptosis and NF-κB signaling.

Previous studies have shown potential therapeutic effects of natural compounds on IBD. Chrysin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been suggested to modulate inflammatory pathways and gut microbiota, but its comprehensive impact on ulcerative colitis remains inadequately explored.This study employed a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model in mice to investigate the effects of Chrysin. Using network pharmacology, we identified key signaling pathways potentially influenced by Chrysin. Experimental approaches included measuring disease activity index scores, serum levels of TNF-α, and assessing colon damage histologically. Transcriptomic and microbiome analyses were conducted to examine changes in gene expression and gut bacterial populations, respectively. Additionally, metabolomic profiling was used to identify alterations in colon metabolites.Chrysin treatment significantly mitigated weight loss and reduced disease activity index scores in DSS-induced mice. There was a notable decrease in serum TNF-α levels and less histological damage in the colon. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression within the NF-κB and IL-17 signaling pathways. Microbiome analysis showed significant shifts in the populations of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Metabolomics analysis identified changes in 298 colon metabolites, implicating several essential metabolic pathways.The findings suggest that Chrysin exerts a dual-action therapeutic effect on ulcerative colitis by reducing inflammation and modulating the gut microbiota. These multifaceted impacts highlight Chrysin's potential utility as a novel therapeutic agent in the clinical management of IBD, offering valuable insights into its mechanisms of action and paving the way for future clinical trials.",

This study aims to investigate the relationship between SLE and hip arthritis progression using MRL/lpr mice, which exhibit early-onset SLE, compared with MRL/MpJ control mice at 14 weeks of age. Through comprehensive histological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses, we evaluated articular cartilage (AC) degeneration, extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, inflammatory responses, and chondrocyte pyroptosis. Our results demonstrated that MRL/lpr mice developed an accelerated hip arthritis-like phenotype, manifesting as enhanced AC degeneration, impaired chondrocyte proliferation, heightened apoptosis and promoted inflammatory cytokine production. Notably, SLE markedly stimulated chondrocyte pyroptosis by increasing pyroptosis-related proteins, including NLRP3, ASC, CASPASE-1 and GSDMD, via activating the NF-κB pathway. These findings establish a novel mechanistic link between SLE and hip arthritis progression, demonstrating that SLE promotes chondrocyte pyroptosis to exacerbate AC degeneration via NF-κB activation, highlighting chondrocyte pyroptosis as a key driver of SLE-associated hip arthritis and a potential therapeutic target for mitigating SLE-induced joint manifestations.",

        "title": "LncRNA MIAT suppresses inflammation in LPS-induced J774A.1 macrophages by promoting autophagy through miR-30a-5p/SOCS1 axi.",
        "abstract": "Accumulated data implicate that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), potentially serving as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for microRNAs (miRNAs). The lncRNA myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) has been demonstrated to regulate inflammation. However, the role of MIAT in the inflammation of RA remains inadequately explored. This study aims to elucidate MIAT's role in the inflammation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms. We observed heightened MIAT expression in LPS-induced J774A.1 cells and collagen-induced arthritis mouse models, in contrast to the expression pattern of miR-30a-5p. Silencing MIAT resulted in increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. Simultaneously, MIAT interference significantly impeded macrophage autophagy, evidenced by decreased expression of autophagy-related markers LC3-II and Beclin-1, alongside increased levels of p62 in LPS-induced J774A.1 cells. Notably, MIAT functioned as a ceRNA, sponging miR-30a-5p and exerting a negative regulatory influence on its expression. SOCS1 emerged as a target of miR-30a-5p, modulated by MIAT. Mechanistically, inhibiting miR-30a-5p reversed the impact of MIAT deficiency in promoting LPS-induced inflammation, while SOCS1 knockdown countered the cytokine inhibitory effect induced by silencing miR-30a-5p. In summary, this study indicates that lncRNA MIAT suppresses inflammation in LPS-induced J774A.1 macrophages by stimulating autophagy through the miR-30a-5p/SOCS1 axis. This suggests that MIAT holds promise as a potential therapeutic target for RA inflammation.",

        "title": "Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Dual Inhibitor Targeting Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9.",
        "abstract": "The aberrant secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells is the principal cause of inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9, sequestered to the endosomal compartment of dendritic cells and macrophages, are closely associated with the initiation and progression of these diseases. Therefore, the development of drugs targeting dysregulated endosomal TLRs is imperative to mitigate systemic inflammation. Here, we applied the principles of computer-aided drug discovery to identify a novel low-molecular-weight compound, TLR inhibitory compound 10 (TIC10), and its potent derivative (TIC10g), which demonstrated dual inhibition of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling pathways. Compared to TIC10, TIC10g exhibited a more pronounced inhibition of the TLR7- and TLR9-mediated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α in a mouse macrophage cell line and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells in a concentration-dependent manner. While TIC10g slightly prevented TLR3 and TLR8 activation, it had no impact on cell surface TLRs (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, or TLR5), indicating its selectivity for TLR7 and TLR9. Additionally, mechanistic studies suggested that TIC10g interfered with TLR9 activation by CpG DNA and suppressed downstream pathways by directly binding to TLR9. Western blot analysis revealed that TIC10g downregulated the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, p38-MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These findings indicate that the novel ligand, TIC10g, is a specific dual inhibitor of endosomal TLRs (TLR7 and TLR9), disrupting MAPK- and NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory gene expression.",

        "title": "Circ_0011058 alleviates RA pathology through the circ_0011058/miR-335-5p/CUL4B signal axis.",
        "abstract": "Our previous study found that Cullin 4B (CUL4B) inhibited rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology through glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3β)/canonical Wnt signalling pathway. In this work, pre-experiment and bioinformatics analysis suggested that circ_0011058 may lead to the up-regulation of CUL4B expression by inhibiting miR-335-5p. Therefore, we studied whether circ_0011058 can promote the expression of CUL4B through sponging the miR-335-5p and further promote the pathological development of RA. Bioinformatics prediction, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot (WB), double luciferase reporter gene and other relevant methods were used to study the inhibition of circ_0011058 on RA pathology and its molecular mechanism. Results showed that the expression of circ_0011058 was significantly increased in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats and RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The knockout of circ_0011058 inhibited the proliferation of AA FLS and RA FLS, decreased the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), fibronectin, which showed that circ_0011058 had a strong role in promoting RA pathology. Furthermore, miR-335-5p expression was reduced in AA rats and RA FLS. The highly expressed circ_0011058 directly sponged the miR-335-5p, which led to the increase of CUL4B expression and promoted the activation of the GSK3β/canonical signalling pathway. Finally, we confirmed that miR-335-5p mediated the roles of circ_0011058 in promoting RA pathological development, which showed that the circ_0011058/miR-335-5p/CUL4B signal axis was involved in RA pathology. This work was of great significance for clarifying the roles of circ_0011058 in RA pathology, and further work was needed to establish whether circ_0011058 was a potential therapeutic target or diagnostic marker for RA.",
